THIS LAYOUT IS WHACK RN

even thought I combined the two rgb and macro layers via still has them seperate after a reflash


rgb layer and func layer combined as via only supports 4 layers

may have to flash by using twesers on two pins reset button is whack

custom qmk tap dances and keycodes show up as wierd hex codes in via

via will break if a layer higher than 4 (3 when index starts at 0) is switched to
